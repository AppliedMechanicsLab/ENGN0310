# Grading

## Grading distribution


The grade in the course will be based on the students' performance in the following categories 

1. Homeworks, 
2. Midterm exam, 
3. Labs, and 
4. Final exam. 
 
Each student will have some flexibility in deciding how the total points for the course should be distributed among the different categories for their individual case. The Homeworks category can contain anywhere between $30$ and $40$ points. The  Midterm exam category can contain anywhere between $20$ and $30$ points. The Labs category can count for anywhere between $20$ and $30$ points, and the Final exam category can count for anywhere between $20$ and $30$ points. That is:

| Item         | Points  |
|--------------|---------|
| Homeworks    | $30-40$ |
| Midterm exam | $10-20$ | 
| Labs         | $20-30$  |
| Final exam   | $20-30$  |

<!-- Originally the midterm was for 20-30, changed it to 10-20 -->

The points from the different categories should still add up to $100$ points.  


<details><summary> Example </summary>

For example, a student, named Andreia, might decide to have her Homeworks count for $35$ points, her Midterm for $12$ points, her labs for $28$ points and her final exam for $25$ points. The total points is $35+12+28+25=100$.

<!--SK_AB_Question:  Sayaka, Andrew: Are the letter grades  in undergraduate courses typically based on absolute points, or on a relative performance of the students, i.e.,  the top 10% of the students get an A, etc.? Which do students prefer? I would to choose the option that the students would prefer. I think if I were a student I would prefer absolute grading.  -->




###  Homeworks.

The Midterm and Final exams will be online exams. They will be open notes, and open textbook. Use of Mathematica, Matlab, Python etc. during the exam is allowed. Browsing the internet, use of cellphone, and collaboration of any type during the exams is not allowed. Use of any electronic or print media (e-textbooks, e-notes, hardcopy books different from the textbook) not created by the students or the teaching staff or different from the textbook is not allowed during the exams.  

There will be 9 HW during the course. The time table of when the different HWs will be released and when they will be due can be found [here](https://appliedmechanicslab.github.io/ENGN0310/). All home works will count equally.

<details><summary> Example </summary>


Continuing from the  previous example. Say there were $9$ homeworks during the course. Say that  each of the homeworks count for $100$ points.  Andreia gets the following scores. 

| Homeworks | Score   |
|-----------|---------|
| HW $1$     | $92/100$  |
| HW $2$      | $90/100$  |
| HW $3$      | $30/100$  |
| HW $4$      | $40/100$  |
| HW $5$      | $75/100$ |
| HW $6$      | $98/100$  |
| HW $7$      | $100/100$ |
| HW $8$      | $65/100$ |
| HW $9$      | $95/100$  |


Let's arrange the above scores, with best scores  on the top

| Homeworks | Score   |
|-----------|---------|
| HW $7$      | $100/100$ |
| HW $6$      | $98/100$  |
| HW $9$      | $95/100$  |
| HW $1$      | $92/100$  |
| HW $2$      | $90/100$  |
| HW $5$      | $75/100$  |
| HW $8$      | $65/100$  |
| HW $4$      | $40/100$  |
| HW $3$      | $30/100$  |

Then out of the seven scores that count the total is $615$, which out of $700$ points is approximately $88%$, so out of $35$ total points for homework Andreia gets $30.75$.

### Exams 

The Midterm and Final exams will be in-person, open notes, open textbook. Use of Mathematica, Matlab, Python etc. during the exam is allowed. Browsing the internet, use of cellphone, and collaboration of any type during the exams is not allowed. Use of any electronic or print media (e-textbooks, e-notes, hardcopy books different from the textbook) not created by the students or the teaching staff is not allowed during the exams.  


#### Midterm exam

The scheduled date for the Midterm exam is : $10/22$


</details>

#### Final exam

The scheduled date for the Final exam is : $12/14$

<details><summary> Example </summary> Andreia gets $90/100$ in on the Midterm and $85/100$ on the Final. So out of $12$ possible points for the Midterm she gets $10.8$ and out of $25$ possible points for the Final Andreia gets $21.25$.


</details>

#### Lab.

There will be three labs in this course, and each will be followed by a lab report. The labs will be done in groups of $4$ to $5$ and after each lab each student will prepare their own lab report independently. 

<details><summary> Example </summary> Andreia get $80/100$ in Lab $1$, and $60/100$ in Lab $2$ and $95/100$ in Lab $3$. So out of $28$ possible points of the labs Andreia gets $21.93$.

</details>

## Grading criterion

The grades in the course will be assigned as follows.

| Grade | Total points |
|-------|--------------|
| A     | $\ge 75$     |
| B     | $74-50$      |
| C     | $49-30$      |
| NC    | $<30$        |


<details><summary> Example </summary> Adding up her scores on each section, $30.75$ for the homeworks, $10.8$ for the Midterm, $21.25$ for the final, and $21.93$ for the labs, Andreia's total score is $84.73$, so her letter grade is an A.
