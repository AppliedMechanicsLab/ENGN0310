# Grading


The grade in the course will be based on the students' performance in the following categories 

1. Homeworks, 
2. Midterm exam, 
3. Labs, and 
4. Final exam. 
 
Each student will have some flexibility in deciding how the total points for the course should be distributed among the different categories for their individual case. The _Homeworks_ category can contain anywhere between 30 and 40 points. The  _Midterm_ exam category can contain anywhere between 20 and 30 points. The _Labs_ category can count for anywhere between 20 and 30 points, and the _Final exam_  category can count for anywhere between 20 and 30 points. That is:

| Item         | Points  |
|--------------|---------|
| Homeworks    | $30-40$ |
| Midterm exam | $10-20$ | 
| Labs         | $20-30$  |
| Final exam   | $20-30$  |

<!-- Originally the midterm was for 20-30, changed it to 10-20 -->

The points from the different categories should still add up to 100 points. 
For example, a student might decide to have their Homeworks count for 35 points their Midterm for 28 points, their labs for 22 points and their final exam for

Which do students prefer? I would to choose the option that the students would prefer. I think if I were a student I would prefer absolute grading.  -->


The grades in the course will be assigned as follows.
