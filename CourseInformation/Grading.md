# Grading

## Grading distribution


The grade in the course will be based on the students' performance in the following categories 

1. Homeworks, 
2. Midterm exam, 
3. Labs, and 
4. Final exam. 
 
Each student will have some flexibility in deciding how the total points for the course should be distributed among the different categories for their individual case. The <font color='LightBlue'>Homeworks</font>
 category can contain anywhere between 30 and 40 points. The  _Midterm_ exam category can contain anywhere between 20 and 30 points. The _Labs_ category can count for anywhere between 20 and 30 points, and the _Final exam_  category can count for anywhere between 20 and 30 points. That is:

| Item         | Points  |
|--------------|---------|
| Homeworks    | $30-40$ |
| Midterm exam | $10-20$ | 
| Labs         | $20-30$  |
| Final exam   | $20-30$  |

<!-- Originally the midterm was for 20-30, changed it to 10-20 -->

The points from the different categories should still add up to 100 points.  

_Example_

For example, a student, named Andreia, might decide to have their Homeworks count for 35 points their Midterm for 12 points, their labs for 28 points and their final exam 25 points. The total points is 35+12+28+25=100


<!--SK_AB_Question:  Sayaka, Andrew: Are the letter grades  in undergraduate courses typically based on absolute points, or on a relative performance of the students, i.e.,  the top 10% of the students get an A, etc.? Which do students prefer? I would to choose the option that the students would prefer. I think if I were a student I would prefer absolute grading.  -->




###  Homeworks.

The Midterm and Final exams will be in-person, open notes, open textbook. Use of Mathematica, Matlab, Python etc. during the exam is allowed. Browsing the internet, use of cellphone, and collaboration of any type during the exams is not allowed. Use of any electronic or print media (e-textbooks, e-notes, hardcopy books different from the textbook) not created by the students or the teaching staff is not allowed during the exams.  

There will be 8 HW during the course. The time table of when the different HWs will be released and when they will be due can be found [here](../CourseInformation/Homeworks.md). All home works will count equally.

_Example_
Continuing from the  previous example. Say there were 8 homeworks during the course. Say that during each of the homeworks count for 100 points.  Andreia gets the following score. 

| Homeworks | Score   |
|-----------|---------|
| HW 1     | 92/100  |
| HW 2      | 90/100  |
| HW 3      | 30/100  |
| HW 4      | 40/100  |
| HW 5      | 75/100  |
| HW 6      | 98/100  |
| HW 7      | 100/100 |
| HW 8      | 65/100  |
