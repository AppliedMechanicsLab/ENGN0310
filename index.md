#### Syllabus

Mechanical behavior of materials and analysis of stress and deformation in engineering structures and continuous media. Topics include concepts of stress and strain; the elastic, plastic, and time-dependent response of materials; principles of structural analysis and application to simple bar structures, beam theory, instability and buckling, torsion of shafts; general three-dimensional states of stress; Mohr's circle; stress concentrations. Lectures, recitations, and laboratory. Prerequisite: ENGN 0030.

#### Grading

The grade in the course will be based on the students' performance in the following categories 

* Homeworks, 
* Midterm exam, 
* Labs, and 
* Final exam. 
 
Each student will have some flexibility in deciding how the total points for the course should be distributed among the different categories for their individual case. The _Homeworks_ category can contain anywhere between 30 and 40 points. The _Midterm exam_ category can contain anywhere between 10 and 20 points. The _Labs_ category can count for anywhere between 20 and 30 points, and the _Final exam_ category can count for anywhere between 20 and 30 points.

## Learning resources <!--HK_to_HK: done with this section-->

* [Lecture Notes](CourseNotes/CourseTopics.md)

#### Software
* Mathematica 
    - [Mathematica Download page](https://www.brown.edu/information-technology/software/)
    - [Mathematica learning material](https://appliedmechanicslab.github.io/appliedmechanicslab/Mathematica_software_commands.html)

Python, Matlab, Maple, etc. can also be used for the HWs and exams. However, the lectures and recitations will be carried out solely using Mathematica. Questions related to Python, Matlab can asked during the Instructor or TA office hours.   

<!-- AB_TODO : If you know any good online resources to learn Python and/or Matlab please  include them here. Delete this TODO in you have read it -->


## Homeworks <!-- HK_to_HK: HK done with this section -->

Nine Homework (HW) sets will be released and graded during the course. However, only the seven best HW scores will be used for calculating the grade. The schedule of when the HWs will be released and when they are due can be see in the course calendar. 

<!-- AB_TODO: Please update the above paragraph based on your latest schedule. Also update this HW schedule in the course calendar, the one that shows up on the home page of the course website -->
