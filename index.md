Python, Matlab, Maple, etc. can also be used for the HWs and exams. However, the lectures and recitations will be carried out solely using Mathematica. Questions related to Python, Matlab can asked during the Intructor or TA office hours.   

## Homeworks

Ten Homeworks (HWs) will be relesed and graded during the course. However, only the eight best HW scores will be used for calculating the grade.
