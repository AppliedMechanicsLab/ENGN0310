# Lab1: Uniaxial tensile testing lab

## 1. Introduction and objective
The design of material of structures so that they function properly requires an understanding of the mechancial behavior of the materials being used. Generally, to determine how materials behave when they are subjected to loads, we perform experiments using testing machines (see the figure below). 
The usual procedure is to take a small specimen of the material, put the specimen in testing machines, apply the loads, and then measure the deformations(like the changes in length and diameters).

In this lab, we will test the mechancial behavior of the materials via uniaxial tensile testing. We will test the rubber rods with different length and area ( see schematics below).

Through the lab, we are going to answer:
1. how does the length of the specimen change when applying different loads?

2. how to determine the strain of a point of the specimen? and how the strain of a point relates to the corresponding displacement?

3. For specimens of the same material but in different geometry, will they have the same mechanical behaviors?

## 5. Experimental setup

### Task 1: Measure the force and the displacement of a rubber bar under uniaxial tensile testing (the whole steps see illustration below)

  (a) Choose the specimen of lengtn of $150 ~\rm mm$ and diameter of $9.525 ~\rm mm$

  (b)Clamp the two bar ends follwing the marks on the bar

  (c) Proceed to load with specific dispacment at $3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 ~\rm mm$.

  (d) Record the corresponding force to each applied displacment

### Task 2: 
  (a)15 cm 



### Task 3
  (a) 20 cm 

## 6. Data analysis


## 7. Lab report guidelines
1. There should be a cover page that contains the title of the lab, name of the author, name of the group members, date, and the name of the class. 

2. Plots should look professional. There should be no auto-generated Excel plots. Any figures should have a caption explaining the purpose of the figure and labeled axes with units, all in readably large text. Specific things to avoid are shadow on line plots, having grid lines on only one axis, and unnecessary overuse of color. Points will be deducted if your plots do not look professional!

3. Tabulated raw data should be included in the appendices, not in the body of the report. Additional figures not essential to the body of the report may be included in the appendices as well. Make sure to cite (refer to) every picture (appendix and body alike) in your report.

3. A good resource for lab report preparation is the Mayfield Handbook of Technical and Scientific Writing (http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/home.htm).

4. Lab reports should be submitted electronically on Canvas in PDF format. No paper reports will be accepted.
