# Lab1: Uniaxial tensile testing lab

## 1. Introduction and objective
The design of material of structures so that they function properly requires an understanding of the mechancial behavior of the materials being used. Generally, to determine how materials behave when they are subjected to loads, we perform experiments using testing machines (see the figure below). 
The usual procedure is to take a small specimen of the material, put the specimen in testing machines, apply the loads, and then measure the deformations(like the changes in length and diameters).

In this lab, we will test the mechancial behavior of the materials via uniaxial tensile testing. We will test the rubber rods with different length and area ( see schematics below)

Through the lab, we are going to answer:
1. how does the length of the specimen change when applying different loads?

2. how to determine the strain of a point of the specimen? and how the strain of a point relates to the corresponding displacement?

3. For specimens of the same material but in different geometry, will they have the same mechanical behaviors?
