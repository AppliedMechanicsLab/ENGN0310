4. Change the criteria for end of the test. Set it at some relatively high measurement level (beyond what we intend to measure in the experiment), for instance at  50mm, etc, so that the test won't stop before we actually want it to.

5. Next, go to the Export tab. This is to ensure we get the raw data output to csv file. Select "After each test" "csv" and ensure that the "Raw data" is switched ON.
