# Lab2: Three point bending testing lab

## 1. Introduction and objective
In applied mechanics, bending characterize the behavior of a slender structural element, like a bar, subjected to an lateral load, that is, forces or moments having their vectors perpendicular to the  axis of the element.
There are many classical bending theories to analyze the bending behavior of materials, such as Euler-Bernoulli bending theory, which we will cover in the class.

In this lab, we will conduct a three point bending test and compare the deflection with the predicetd deflection from the theory (see schematics below).

## 7. Lab report guidelines
1. The lab report should be written as a single, professional-prepared document for each student. 
Please organize your report using the structure given on the next Section: Lab report organization. 
Please use International System of Units (SI), for example using meter and kilogram instead of inch and pounds.

2. There should be a **cover page** that contains the title of the lab, name of the author, name of the group members, date, and the name of the class. 

3. **Plots should look professional**. There should be no auto-generated Excel plots. Any figures should have a caption explaining the purpose of the figure and labeled axes with units, all in readably large text. Specific things to avoid are shadow on line plots, having grid lines on only one axis, and unnecessary overuse of color. Points will be deducted if your plots do not look professional. 

4. Tabulated raw data should be included in the appendices, not in the body of the report. Additional figures not essential to the body of the report may be included in the appendices as well. Make sure to cite (refer to) every picture (appendix and body alike) in your report.

5. A good resource for lab report preparation is the Mayfield Handbook of Technical and Scientific Writing (https://www.mit.edu/course/21/21.guide/).

6. Lab reports should be submitted electronically on Canvas in PDF format. No paper reports will be accepted.

## 8. Lab report organization 

1. **Introduction**: Write a brief statement describing the purpose of the lab.

2. **Methods and Materials**: Describe the experimental setup and procedural details for the experiment.

3. **Results and Discussion**: Answer all questions in the tasks and comment on the associated theoretical aspect. 

4. **Conclusion**: Write a brief statement describing your conclusions and what you learned in the lab.

5. **Appendices**: Include tables of your raw data, detailed calculations, and other information/figures that you deem pertinent but non-essential to the body of your report.
