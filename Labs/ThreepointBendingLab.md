# Lab2: Three point bending testing lab

## 1. Introduction and objective
In applied mechanics, bending characterize the behavior of a slender structural element, like a bar, subjected to an lateral load, that is, forces or moments having their vectors perpendicular to the  axis of the element.
There are many classical bending theories to analyze the bending behavior of materials, such as Euler-Bernoulli bending theory, which we will cover in the class.

In this lab, we will conduct a three point bending test and compare the deflection with the predicetd deflection from the theory (see schematics below).
