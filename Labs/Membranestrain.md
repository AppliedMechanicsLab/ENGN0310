# Lab3: Membrane strain measuring lab

## 1. Introduction and objective
Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are important mechanical properties of materials. 
Young's modulus quantifies the relationship between tensile stress and corresponding axial strain and predicts how much a material sample extends under tension or shortens under compression.
Poisson's ratio is a measure of the deformation of a material in directions perpendicular to the specific direction of loading.


In this lab, our job is to measure the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a sheet of silicone via uniaxial loading test. We will draw a square on the undeformed sheet (see schematics below). After loading, the square will change to a rectangle. Through measuring the changes of the shape and loading force, we can figure out Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the material.
