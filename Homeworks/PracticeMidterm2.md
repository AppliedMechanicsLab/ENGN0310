#### Problem 1. 

![](PickHere)

Figure 1

Assume we have the bar shown in figure 1 with radius given by the expression $r(x)=r\_{o} e^{ax}$ with a torque $T$ applied at the end of the bar $B$. What is the twist at $B$?

Figure 3

Assume we have the bar shown in figure 2 with cross section given in figure 3. The inner bar has a radius of $r\_{A}$ and is made of a material with stiffness modulus $G\_{A}$ and the outer bar has a radius of $r\_{B}$ and is made of a material with stiffness $G\_{B}$. What is the torque that has to be applied to produce a twist of $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$ at the end of the bar?

Figure 5

Assume we have the triangular bar given in figure 4 with length $L$ and made of a material with a stiffness modulus $G$, what is the angle of twist at the end of the bar due to an applied torque $T$? Hint: The centriod of a triangle with height $h$ and base length $b$ is along the midpoint, $\frac{h}{3}$ from the base, shown as the location of the coordinate axis in figure 5. You can also find this find this using the MomentOfInertia command in Mathematica for a triangle. The answer you should get for the polar moment of inertia is $J=bh\left(\frac{b^2}{48} + \frac{h^2}{36}\right)$.

Figure 6

Assume we have the bar given in figure 6 with total length $L=3m$, where forces are applied at points $B$, $C$, and $D$ with magnitudes $60kN$, $40kN$, and $20kN$ respectively. Also assume that the section of the bar $AB$ has diameter $D\_{AB}=75mm$ and is made of steel, with $G\_{AB}=77GPa$ and thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha\_{AB} = 10\times10^{-6}\frac{1}{°C}$. Section $BC$ is tapered linearly from a diameter of $75mm$ to a diameter of $25mm$ and is made of titanium, with $G\_{BC}=44GPa$ and $\alpha\_{BC} = 8.4\times10^{-6}\frac{1}{°C}$. Section $CD$ has diameter $D\_{CD}=25mm$ and is also made of steel. If the bar is initially at room temperature ($20°C$), at what temperature will the net displacement at point $D$ be zero?

Figure 7

Assume we have the bar in figure 7, which a circular cross section with a radius that tapers linearly from $r\_{i}$ to $r\_{f}$ and an applied force of $P$ at point $B$. If the bar is made of steel, with $E=200GPa$ and $\rho = 7850$
