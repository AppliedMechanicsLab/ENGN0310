1. Determine the elongation $\Delta L$ when the tensile stress in a $25~\rm{cm}$ long steel bar is equal to $100~\rm{MPa}$. 

2. Determine the tensile force on a cylindrical titanium alloy bar of $2~\rm{cm}$ diameter, if the unit elongation is $0.6 \times 10^{-3}$. 

3. What is the ratio of Young's modulus $E$ of the materials of two bars if the bars are of the same size and their unit elongations are in the ratio 15/8 when subjected to equal tensile loading?

4. (i) Determine the diameter $d$ of the steel bolts $N$ of a press for a maximum compressive force $P = 490~\rm{kN}$, if the working stress for steel in this case is $\sigma_w = 70~\rm{MPa}$. 

    (ii) Determine the elongation $\Delta L$ã€€of the bolts at the maximum load, if the length between their heads is $L = 125~\rm{cm}$.

5. A spring with stiffness $k$ is encased in a tube of length $L$, which is shorter than the spring by length $h$. Derive an expression for the compression $\Delta L$ of the tube when the spring is compressed by an axial load $P$ applied to the plate. Assume that the tube has an inner diameter $d_i$, outer diameter $d_o$, and Young's modulus $E$. You may ignore the mass of the plate.
