1. Determine the elongation $\Delta L$ when the tensile stress in a $25~\rm{cm}$ long steel bar is equal to $100~\rm{MPa}$. 

2. Determine the tensile force on a cylindrical titanium alloy bar of $2~\rm{cm}$ diameter, if the unit elongation is $0.6 \times 10^{-3}$. 

3. (i) What is the ratio of Young's modulus $E$ of the materials of two bars if the bars are of the same size and their unit elongations are in the ratio 5/3 when subjected to equal tensile loading?

    (ii) Determine the elongations in each bar if one is made of steel, the other is made of titanium alloy, and the tensile stress is $50~\rm{MPa}$.

4. A piece of wire $6~\rm{mm}$ thick and $30~\rm{m}$ long is subjected to a tensile force $P = 5~\rm{kN}$. If the wire elongates by $2~\rm{cm}$, what is its Young's modulus?

5. (i) Determine the diameter $d$ of the steel bolts $N$ of a press for a maximum compressive force $P = 490~\rm{kN}$, if the working stress for steel in this case is $\sigma_w = 70~\rm{MPa}$. 

    (ii) Determine the elongation $\Delta L$ã€€of the bolts at the maximum load, if the length between their heads is $L = 125~\rm{cm}$.

6. A structure consisting of two equal steel bars 5 meters long and with hinged ends is submitted to the action of a vertical load P. Determine the necessary cross sectional areas of the bars and the deflection of the point $B$ ($BB'$) when $P = 20~\rm{kN}$ and the working stress is $\sigma_w = 70~\rm{MPa}$.The initial angle of inclination of the bars is $\theta = 30~\degree$. 


7. A spring with stiffness $k$ is encased in a tube of length $L$, which is shorter than the spring by length $h$. Derive an expression for the compression $\Delta L$ of the tube when the spring is compressed by an axial load $P$ applied to the plate. Assume that the tube has an inner diameter $d_i$, outer diameter $d_o$, and Young's modulus $E$. You may ignore the mass of the plate.
