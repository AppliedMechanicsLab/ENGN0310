Pb.1 

(a) Some configuration $\mathcal{C}_1$. Find the bending momemnt along the length of the beam. 

(b) For the configuration $\mathcal{C}$, find the maximum  bending stress, which we are asking for 
$$
\max_{X_1\in (0,l)} \max_{X_{2}\in (-h/2, h/2)} \sigma_{11}(X_1,X_2,X_3)
$$ 


$$
\sigma_{11}(X_1,X_2,X_3)=-\frac{M(X_1)}{I(X_1)} X_2
$$

(c) For the  $\mathcal{C}$ find the deflection at the point $X_1=\text{some value}$
