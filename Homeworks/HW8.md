**Problem 1 (30pts total)** 

Consider the configuration shown below, where $M_0=500~\rm N \cdot \rm m$ $L=2 ~\rm m$, $h = 10~\rm{cm}$ and the dimension in the $\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}\_{\rm 3}$ direction is $b=5~\rm{cm}$. Use $E = 120~\rm{GPa}$.

**Problem 3 (40pts total)**

Consider the simply-supported beam shown below, where $L=2~\rm m$ and the beam's cross section is a square with $50~\rm{mm}$ side length. If the maximum permissible deflection in the beam is $5~\rm{mm}$ and the allowable bending stress is 150 MPa, find the maximum allowable $M_0$. Use $E = 200~\rm{GPa}$. You can solve this in the following steps.
