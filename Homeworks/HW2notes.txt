<--Let us cut the  $\mathcal{B}_0$, into two pieces, $^1\mathcal{B}$ and $^2\mathcal{B}$. Specifically, let us cut $\mathcal{B}$ with the $A$-$A'$ plane (see Figure), which is normal to the bar's axis $\pm \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_a$.

We will call the  left piece $^1\mathcal{B}$ and the right piece  $^2\mathcal{B}$.

Let the  surface on $^1\mathcal{B}$ that is newly created be called $S^1$ and that that on  $^2\mathcal{B}$ that is newly created be called $S^2$. 

The vector $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}^{1}$ is (outward) normal to $S^1$. By normal we mean that $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}^{1}$ is perpendicular to $S^1$ and points away from the $^1\mathcal{B}$ internal matter (the atoms and molecules composing the Bar) towards the outside. Similarly, $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}^{1}$ is normal to $S^2$, i.e., it is perpendicular to $S^2$ and points away from the $^2\mathcal{B}$ internal matter and towards the outside.

Note that $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}^{1}=-\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}^{2}$ -->
