Three Hr Exam. 


Topics to cover:


# Pb 1
20 pts Shear stress design: Given a shear strength, how much load can we apply so that the design is safe.  


# Pb 2
10 pts (a) Given the loading: what is the stress tensor. 
10 pts (b) For this given stress tensor what is the maximum and minimum values of the scalar part of normal component of the traction vector, and what are the corresponding angles. 
10 pts (c) For this given stress tensor what is the maximum and 10pts (d) minimum values of the scalar part of shear component of the traction vector, and what are the corresponding angles. 
(d)  For this given stress tensor draw the Mohr Circle.
