Say the end has the force $f\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_2$. The moment on the cross-section $X_1$ due to the force is  $(l-X_1)\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_1\times f\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_2=(l-X_1)f \hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_3$. Let us a take closer look at how we got this results. 

Just consider the segement of beam lying to the right of the cross-section at $X_1$. We denote the cross-section at $X_1$ as $\Gamma(X_1)$. The moment due to the force $\boldsymbol{f}$ at the centeroid of $\Gamma(X_1)$ is $(l-X_1)\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}\_1\times f\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}\_2$. Let us call this momemnt the applied moment $\boldsymbol{M}_{X_1,\rm ap}$






Thus we have that the momemnt at the cross-section $(X_1,\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_1)$ is




$$
\begin{equation}
M(x)=(l-x)f
\end{equation}
$$
