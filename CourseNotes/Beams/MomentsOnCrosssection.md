# Definition of moments on cross-sections. 


#### $\boldsymbol{M}(X_1,\hat{E}_1)$

The moment of the surface $\Gamma(X_1,\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_1)$ is the moment about the centeroid of the surface $\Gamma(X_1)$ due to traction on the surface  $\Gamma(X_1,\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_1)$. We denote this moment as $\boldsymbol{M}(X_1,\hat{E}_1)$


#### $\boldsymbol{M}(X_1,-\hat{E}_1)$

The moment on the surface $\Gamma(X_1,\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_1)$ is the moment about the centeroid of the surface $\Gamma(X_1)$ due to traction on the surface  $\Gamma(X_1,-\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_1)$. We denote this moment as $\boldsymbol{M}(X_1,-\hat{E}_1)$.
