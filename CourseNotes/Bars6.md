##  Material properties and cross-sectional area varying along the length

Previously we derived the displacement field when the cross-section area of the bar is varying along its length. In that case we got that



$$
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{F}&=
\left(
\int_{0}^{L}\frac{dX}{E A(X)}
\right)^{-1}
\boldsymbol{\delta}
\label{eq:HookesLaw}
\end{align}
$$

In the case that the Young's modulus also varies along the length we get that  

$$
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{F}&=
\left(
\int_{0}^{L}\frac{dX}{E(X) A(X)}
\right)^{-1}
\boldsymbol{\delta}
\end{align}
$$

We will not be deriving the above equation. However, the steps on the derivation/proof for the above equation are almost the same as the one we used for deriving $\eqref{eq:HookesLaw}$.
