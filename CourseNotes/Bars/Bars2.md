# Displacement field

We have been talking about the change in length $\delta$ as the difference between the final length, $l$, and initial length, $L$, i.e., $\delta=l-L$. However, the change in length can be defined in an alternate manner--a manner that is more abstract but that which can be generalized to more complicated cases, like torsion and bending. For that reason, we will explore that alternate means of defining $\delta$ below.

Let the position vector of the $\Gamma^{\mathscr{h}}$'s centroid, $\mathcal{C}$, before any forces are applied to the bar be $\boldsymbol{X}(\mathcal{C})$ (red arrow in the top panel of the above figure). On choosing the origin of the physical space $\mathcal{E}^3$ to be located at the centroid of the bar's left face, we get that $\boldsymbol{X}(\mathcal{C})=L\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}\_{\rm a}$, and after the application of force the position vector of the centriod becomes $\boldsymbol{x}(\mathcal{C})$. If the length of bar after deformation is $l$ then we can express the position vector of $\mathcal{C}$ in the deformed configuration as $\boldsymbol{x}(\mathcal{C})=l\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}\_{\rm a}$. The vector $\boldsymbol{u}(\mathcal{C})=\boldsymbol{x}(\mathcal{C})-\boldsymbol{X}(\mathcal{C})$ is called the displacement of the bar's right face. This displacement vector can be written as

$$
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{u}(\mathcal{C})=(l-L) \hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_{\rm a}.
\end{equation}
$$

We define $\delta$ to be
$$
\begin{equation}
\delta := \boldsymbol{u}(\mathcal{C})â‹… \hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_{a},
\end{equation}
$$

where the dot in the above equation denotes the "dot product between vectors." It follows from the last two equations that
$$
\begin{equation}
\delta = l-L,
\end{equation}
$$ 
which matches our rudimentary definition for $\delta$. 

#### Using the position vectors of particles when the solid is undeformed as their names


![](ClassNotes-8.jpg) 


There are a lot more points in $\mathcal{B}\_{\rm ref}$ other then just $\mathcal{C}$. We will soon run of letters to name them all. Therefore we will use the following strategy to name all the material particles composing the solid $\mathcal{B}\_{\rm Ref}$. Since each of the material
 particle  have a unique position vector when the bar is undeformed we can, in fact, use those position vectors to refer to them. That is, say the particle $\mathcal{P}$ has the position vector $\boldsymbol{P}$ in the reference configuration $\mathcal{B}\_{\rm ref}$. Then instead of saying the material particle $\mathcal{P}$ we can just start saying the material particle $\boldsymbol{P}$. To elabortate on this concept further, we have marked 10 material particle in the figure above using vertical lines. The different materials particles are marked used different colors, the left most materials particle using a gray vertical and the right most materials particle using a blue verticle lines. Before the application of any forces, i.e., in the reference configuration, the gray material particle's position vector is $^0\boldsymbol{X}$, the red material particle's position vector is $^1\boldsymbol{X}$, the orange material particle's position vector is $^2\boldsymbol{X}$ and so on. After deformation, i.e., after the application of forces,  all material particles leaving the left most one (the one shown in gray) move to new locations. The  position vector of a material particle 
  after the application of forces, i.e., in the deformed configuration, is again marked  using a verticle line, albeit of a shorter length, using the same color as that was used to mark its position in the reference configuration. In the deformed configuration, the gray material particle's position vector is $\boldsymbol{x}(^0\boldsymbol{X})$, or $^0\boldsymbol{x}$ for short;  the red material particle's position vector $\boldsymbol{x}(^1\boldsymbol{X})$, or $^1\boldsymbol{x}$ for short, the orange material particle's position vector is $\boldsymbol{x}(^2\boldsymbol{X})$, or $^2\boldsymbol{x}$, for short and so on.


The material particle $\boldsymbol{X}$ (That is a material particle which when the bar is undeformed has the position vector $\boldsymbol{X}$) has the new position vector $\boldsymbol{x}(\boldsymbol{X})$ when the bar is deformed. We will call the vector 

$$
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{X}):=\boldsymbol{x}(\boldsymbol{X})-\boldsymbol{X}
\end{equation}
$$
the displacement vector of $\boldsymbol{X}$, and the function $\boldsymbol{u} :\mathcal{B}\_{\rm Ref}\to \mathcal{B}$ the displacement field. Carrying on the previous example, the gray material particle's displacement vector is $\boldsymbol{u}(^0\\!\boldsymbol{X})=^0\boldsymbol{x}- ^0\boldsymbol{X}$ ;  the red material particle's displacement vector $\boldsymbol{u}(^1\boldsymbol{X})=^1\boldsymbol{x}-^1\boldsymbol{X}$, the orange material particle's displacement vector is $\boldsymbol{u}(^2\boldsymbol{X})=^2\boldsymbol{x}-^2\boldsymbol{X}$, and so on.

When the bar remains aligned with $\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}\_a$ before and after deformation, we can define the scalar dispplacement field $u:[0,L]\to [0,l]$ as,
$$
\begin{equation}
u(X):=\boldsymbol{u}(X\hat{\boldsymbol{E}}_a).\boldsymbol{E}_a
\end{equation}
$$

is called the bar's change in length (length change
). When $\delta>0$ we say that the bar has been stretched, and $\delta$ is called extension, and when  $\delta<0$ we say that the bar has been compressed, and $\delta$ is called compression.


As we can see from the above discussion the 
\begin{equation}
\delta=
\end{equation}
