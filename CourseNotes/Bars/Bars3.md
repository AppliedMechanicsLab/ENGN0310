Let $\boldsymbol{u}$ be the displacement field of a bar. In the [previous section](./Bars2.md) we learnt that $\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{X})$ gives us the displacement of the material particle $\boldsymbol{X}$. The displacement vector tells us by how much the materials particle has moved by on the application of the force. (Recall that we are referring to materials particles by their position vector in the reference configuration,  
The displacement of the materials particle located at
