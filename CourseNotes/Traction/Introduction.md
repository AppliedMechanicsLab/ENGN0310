# Traction

Informally speaking traction is force per unit area. When we were working with bars we difined the normal component of the axial traction vector $\sigma_{11}$ as $F/A$, where $F\uv{E}\_{a}$ is the force acting on the bar's end and the $A$ is the constant 




If we want to know the net force acting on a surface $\mathcal{S}$ of a body $\mathcal{B}$. 
If mass were analogous to force then traction would be analogous to mass density. 
The first main difference in this analogy, of course, is that force is a vector, while mass is scalar. Like density traction is also field. That can be constant throughout the solid or it can vary from point to point. For example, the material density in an  ingot of steel will more or less stay constant throughout the volume of the ingot. When as the density in a baked pumpkin pike will likely be higher at materials particles that are closer to the surfaces and smaller in the interior. The variation of density is expressed by defining the a function  $\rho(X)$ such that the mass in an infinitesimal volume containing $X$ is $\rho(X)\, dV$.  




Therefore, albeit that denisty is a scalar, traction Secondly mass density is defined terms of unit volume, i.e., 

  while traction is defined in terms of unit area.
