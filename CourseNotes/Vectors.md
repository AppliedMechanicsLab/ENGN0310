Typically a vector is defined an mathematical object that has direction and magnitude.  

To elaborate on the above point abit consider a point $X$ in the physical space $\math$that we live in. Now imagine a molecule of nitrogen whizzing throught 

In the context of the physical space $\mathbb{E}^3$, i.e., the space in which we are live in, the set of vectors at a certain point in space  can be thought of as the set of velocities from all possible motions a material particle (say fly, a molecule of nitrogen, etc.) passing through $X$ could be executing at the time instace the particle is located .

Typically, the above notionis 

Since vectors denote directions they can always be translated from their original position and still be considered the same vector. They can, however, not be rotated, or stretched or compressed.  In summary, translating a vector does not gives us a new vector. Rotating a vector gives us a new vector. Stretching a vector gives us  new vector. Compressing a vector (shorting)

In some textbooks the what we will be referring to as vectors are referred to as _free vectors_

Mathematically speaking, when ignoring relativistic effects the physical space we live in is modeled as a Euclidean 3-space $\mathbb{E}^3$).

More generally/abstractly speaking, vectors in the context of the manifold $\mathcal{M}$  are linear operators that act on elements of $ C^{\infty}(\mathcal{M};\mathbb{R})$ and yield real numbers. The set of vector in the context of
